A Python + Pygame stand-alone, reimplementation of Zachtronic's Dungeons and Diagrams.

Still under development, expect unusual behavior.
Currently loaded with around 47,000 puzzles.

Controls:
* LMB - Place/remove walls
* RMB - Place/remove marks
* SpaceBar - Next puzzle
* R - Reset puzzle
* M - Mute music

To compile to executable, you'll need to have Python installed with the PATH option
selected during install. Then you can just run make.bat on Windows.
