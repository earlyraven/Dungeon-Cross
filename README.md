A Python + Pygame stand-alone, reimplementation of Zachtronic's Dungeons and Diagrams.

Still under development, expect unusual behavior.

Currently loaded with around 47,000 puzzles.

To compile to executable, you'll need to have Python installed with the PATH option
selected during install. Then you can just run make.bat on Windows.
