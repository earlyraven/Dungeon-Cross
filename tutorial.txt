The rules are exactly the same as Zachtronic's Dungeons
and Diagrams.

This game is similar to picross with a few twists. Left
click and drag to place or remove walls. Right click and
drag to place or remove marks.

The numbers on the rows and columns indicate the number
of walls on that column or row.

A treasure chest is always in a 3x3 empty room with exactly
ONE entrance. The chest can appear in ANY of the 3x3 tiles
in that room. (Yes, a treasure chest can appear directly
in the entrance)
#sprite/tut2.png
Any "dead-end" (a tile with three walls surrounding it,
including borders) MUST contain a monster. 
#sprite/tut1.png
A monster must ALWAYS be in a dead-end.

A 2x2 grid (or larger) of empty space can't exist outside 
of a treasure room.

Every empty tile must connect back to every other tile by
some path. There can't be any "islands" of empty tiles.
