Let's have a look at how to solve a puzzle:

There are many ways to solve the puzzles.  This guide follows a
systematic approach.  As you gain experience you may be able to
combine several requirements together at once to reduce the amount
of steps needed.

We begin with the following:
#sprite/guide0.png
This is our starting map.  Let's scan the rows and columns for clues.
#sprite/guide1.png
First, we check each row to see what clues we can use.
Note:
- The 7 indicates that the whole row (except for the dragon) will be walls.
- The 0 indicates that the whole row will be empty.

Now, we can do the same, but for the columns.  See how the 4 and 0 let
us fill in walls and blank spaces respectively.
#sprite/guide3.png
Now we can use the restriction that monsters must appear at a
dead-end to fill in some more walls.  Also note: some monsters have
only one available connection, so that spot must be blank.
#sprite/guide4.png
Now we can use the restriction on chests (must be in a 3x3 walkable
room), to mark some empty tiles.  There's only one valid position
for each of the chests, so we know what the blank squares for the
treasure room are.

With our new knowledge, we can now revisit the row and column hints,
and see what else we can find.
Row hints:
1st 3 -> There's only 3 spots that can have a wall, and we need 3 walls,
so they must all be walls.
2nd 3 -> Same as above.
#sprite/guide6.png
Now we can do the same but for the columns again:
1st 2 -> We already have our 2 walls, so the rest must be blank.
2nd, 3rd, and 4th 2s -> Only one spot remains for the missing wall.
#sprite/guide7.png
Sometimes, after checking vertically and horizontally, we learn more
info that can be used to solve further.  Let's check horizontally again:
3rd 3 -> There's only 2 more spots available and so they must be walls.
#sprite/guide8.png
The treasure room must have a single exit, and there's only one spot
left for it.
#sprite/guide9.png
We can't have an empty non-treasure-room 2x2 region, so we must
place a wall here.
Alternately: Column (2nd 6) -> Only one spot left for the missing wall.
#sprite/guide10_final.png
Both the x-axis 2, and the y-axis 6 indicate the last square here must
be a wall.

Congrats! We've done it.  Now try it out yourself!
