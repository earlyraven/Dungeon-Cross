The rules are exactly the same as Zachtronic's Dungeons and Diagrams.

This game is similar to picross with a few twists.

The numbers on the rows and columns indicate the number of walls on that column or row. 

A treasure chest is always in a 3x3 empty room with exactly ONE entrance. The chest can appear in ANY of the 3x3 tiles in that room. (Yes, a treasure chest can appear directly in the entrance)

Any "dead-end" (a tile with three walls surrounding it, including borders) MUST contain a monster. A dead-end can't exist without a monster.

A 2x2 grid of empty space can't exist outside of a treasure room.

Every empty tile must connect back to every other tile by some path. There can't be any "islands" of empty tiles.
